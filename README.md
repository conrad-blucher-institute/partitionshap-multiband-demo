# `PartitionShap` demo: channel-wise explanations of raster-based machine learning models
Exploring PartitionShap on raster datasets of an arbitrary number of bands/channels

These notebooks use our [SHAP fork](https://github.com/conrad-blucher-institute/shap) with modifications to make it easier to use and visualize multi-channel explanations. 
The EuroSAT notebooks use [TorchSat](https://github.com/sshuair/torchsat), a library for working with PyTorch models whose inputs are rasters with arbitraty number of channels.
